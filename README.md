[Well-tested](https://github.com/signmotion/flutter_image_converter/tree/master/test) and easy-to-use Dart & Flutter image transformer package: ui, widgets, [image](https://pub.dev/packages/image), ImageProvider, bytes, etc.
Works in any direction as an extension.
**You no longer have to worry about writing code to convert images in different formats.**
Feel free to use it in your awesome project.

Share some ‚ù§Ô∏è and star repo to support the [Flutter Image Converter](https://github.com/signmotion/flutter_image_converter).

_If you write an article about **FlutterImageConverter** or any of [these](https://pub.dev/packages?q=publisher%3Asyrokomskyi.com&sort=updated) packages, let me know and I'll post the URL of the article in the **README**_ ü§ù

## üöÄ Usage

### ImageProvider to UI Image

```dart
await AssetImage('1.jpg').uiImage
```

### Package Image to Widget Image

```dart
Image(...).widgetImage
```

### Any formatted raw bytes to Widget Image

```dart
bytes.widgetImage
```

### ImageProvider to PNG raw bytes

```dart
AssetImage('nature.webp').pngUint8List
```

Supports the image providers:

- `AssetImage`
- `FileImage`
- `MemoryImage`
- `NetworkImage`
- any providers from [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages?q=image+provider) inherited from `ImageProvider`

Can detect [all formats](https://github.com/brendan-duncan/image/blob/main/doc/formats.md) from the package [image](https://github.com/brendan-duncan/image).

See folders `example` and `test` for more use cases.

## üîÑ Available Converters

```dart
import 'dart:ui' as ui;
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart' as widget;
import 'package:image/image.dart' as image;
```

## üíõ Thanks

While working on projects, I meet people who make the project better with their outsider and professional view. I want to write down their names here..... and I'd be happy to add your name as well.

Requests and suggestions are warmly welcome. Danke!

Contributions are what make the open-source community such a great place to learn, create, take a new skills, and be inspired.

If this is your first contribution, I'll leave you with some of the best links I've found: they will help you get started or/and become even more efficient.

- [Guide to Making a First Contribution](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions). You will find the guide in your native language.
- [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute). Longread for deep diving for first-timers and for veterans.

The package **FlutterImageConverter** is open-source, stable and well-tested. Development happens on
[GitHub](https://github.com/signmotion/flutter_image_converter). Feel free to report issues
or create a pull-request there.

General questions are best asked on
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/flutter_image_converter).

And here is a curated list of how you can help:

- Documenting the undocumented. Whenever you come across a class, property, or method within our codebase that you're familiar with and notice it lacks documentation, kindly spare a couple of minutes to jot down some helpful notes for your fellow developers.
- Refining the code. While I'm aware it's primarily my responsibility to refactor the code, I wholeheartedly welcome any contributions you're willing to make in this area. Your insights and improvements are appreciated!
- Constructive code reviews. Should you discover a more efficient approach to achieve something, I'm all ears. Your suggestions for enhancement are invaluable.
- Sharing your examples. If you've experimented with our use cases or have crafted some examples of your own, feel free to add them to the `example` directory. Your practical insights can enrich our resource pool.
- Fix typos/grammar mistakes.
- Report bugs and scenarios that are difficult to implement.
- Implement new features by making a pull-request.

## ‚úÖ TODO (perhaps)

Once you start using the **FlutterImageConverter**, it will become easy to choose the functionality to contribute. But if you already get everything you need from this package but have some free time, let me write here what I have planned:

- Explane `Image`, `ImageProvider`, etc. [1](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56431615/963948)
- DONE Check out the Web platform. THANKS [C Davis aka faithoflifedev](https://github.com/signmotion/flutter_image_converter/pull/1).
- Detect formats provided `instantiateImageCodec`.
- SVG?
- IconData?
- Transform images to any formats?

It's just a habit of mine: writing down ideas that come to mind while working on a project. I confess that I rarely return to these notes. But now, hopefully, even if you don't have an idea yet, the above notes will help you choose the suitable "feature" and become a contributor to the open-source community.
